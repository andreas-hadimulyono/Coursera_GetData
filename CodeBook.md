## Variables

There are four variables in the generated output file:

1. Subject ID (subject_id)
2. Activity (activity_label)
3. Variable Name (variable)
4. Average value of measured variable (averageValue)

### Subject ID (subject_id)

Type: numeric

Description: 
Subject identifier, represents individual subject.

### Activity (activity_label)

Type: character

Description: 
The activity related to the measured variable. The data is taken from y_test and y_train files, mapped into activity_labels file to get the descriptive names.

Valid values:
WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING

### Variable Name (variable)

Type: character

Description:
The variable that is measured for each activity. The data only contains the variables that contain the word "mean()" or "std()" inside their names.

Valid values:
"tBodyAcc-mean()-X"
"tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"
"tBodyAcc-mean()-Z"

### Average value of measured variable (averageValue)

Type: number

Description:
This is the average value of the measured variable for each specified subject and activity. The value is derived by taking the average of each individual measurement, grouped by subject and activity.
